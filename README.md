**Project time:** 8.5 hours

## Tech Stack

React - I chose React because it makes it easy to create reusable UI components. The state manangement is easy to use and the JSX syntax is very similar to html. I also used SASS as a CSS preprocessor because it is a powerful tool that helps me write css efficiently and quicker.

## Other Considerations

I would have used TypeScript but did not have enough experience at the time of starting this project.

## Improvements

If I had more time I would like to store the compartive string values in a constants file so that any future changes will only be needed to be done at one place. I would also convert the codebase to Typescript.

The Marketing data in the JSON file all had job ids of 0 so I had to update those to make the data work for this project.

I really enjoyed the project and the only thing that would have made it better for me was if I could have been in communication with the designer. I like to ask for clarifications and also send updates to make sure that everything looks as how the designer wants it to. There were some questions I wanted to ask about spacing that would have helped me develop a styling system that is more scalable. Like how much spacing is needed between headings, labels and paragraphs. Having those values would make setting the spacing for the containers easier.
