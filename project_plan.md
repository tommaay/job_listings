# Project Plan - Jobs Page

## Tech Stack - React

React makes it easy to create reusable UI components. The state manangement is easy to use and the JSX syntax is very similar to html. SASS will be used as a CSS preprocessor to speed up and make the css writing process simpler.

## Estimate

- [] Build components with content markup (jobs page and navigation) - 0.5 day
- [] Style the components (jobs page and navigation) - 1 day
- [] Write business logic to get and format data - 0.5 day
- [] Write unit tests - 1 day
- [] Do a bug bash and fix found bugs - 1 day
- [] Meet with design team for a review - 0.5 day
- [] Make revisions from the review - 0.5 day

The project should take around 5 days to complete.

## Concerns

This project may take longer if there are unforeseen circumstances that come up like a revision of the design after development has started. To minimize this risk I will be be sending updates with the designer and keeping our line of communication available and frequent. The review will be dependent on designer availability so we need to a schedule a meeting ahead of time.

The bug bash will also rely on outside participants availability. Having outside input and testing may catch bugs / design issues that we may not notice since we are more familiar with the design.
